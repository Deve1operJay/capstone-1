    <h1>My Hobbies are:

        <h2>eSports</h2>
            <img src="../assets/images/eSports.jpg" height="200" />

            <p>I'm an avid follower of eSports, I actually used to compete myself! I mainly follow games like League of Legends, CS:GO and Valorant.</p>

        <h2>Classical Piano</h2>
            <img src="../assets/images/piano.jpg" height="400" />

            <p>A fun fact about me, I love playing piano. I'm classically trained and actually really love playing pieces from the Romantic Period! Above is a photo of Fryderyk Chopin, one of my favorite composers! </p>

        <hr />
        <h2>Reading</h2>
            <img src="../assets/images/books.jpg" height="200" />

            <p>I'm just a huge book nerd. I have a bookshelf stuffed to the brim with books that I have either already read, or am in the process of reading.</p>

        <hr />

        <h2>Anime</h2>
            <img src="../assets/images/anime.gif" height="200" />

            <p>Anime is always been a favorite pass time of mine. There's just something about the art style and the music especially! Shown above is Luffy from One Piece, but I would urge you to watch any film by Studio Ghibili as well, the music and art is phenomenal!</p>
